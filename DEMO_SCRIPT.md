## 🎯 Script Outline

### PART 1: Introduction (45 seconds)

**[Show landing page]**

> "Hi! I'm [Your Name], and this is my submission for the Ryze AI Full-Stack Assignment."
>
> "I've built an AI-powered UI Generator that converts natural language into production-ready React components."
>
> "What makes this special is that it uses a deterministic component system with a 3-step AI agent pipeline."
>
> "Let me show you how it works."

**[Hover over the 3 panels]**

> "The interface has three panels: Chat on the left for natural language input, Code Editor in the middle showing the generated code, and Live Preview on the right showing the actual UI."

---

### PART 2: Basic Generation (90 seconds)

**[Type in chat]**

> "Let's start simple. I'll ask it to create a login form."

**[Type: "Create a login form with email and password"]**

**[Press Enter]**

> "Notice the AI is now working through its 3-step process..."

**[Wait for generation, point to chat panel]**

> "First, the Planner agent interprets my intent and selects components."
>
> "Then, the Generator creates actual React code using only our fixed component library."
>
> "Finally, the Explainer tells me why it made those decisions."

**[Scroll through generated code]**

> "Here's the generated code. It's using our Button, Card, and Input components from the fixed library."

**[Show live preview]**

> "And here's the live preview - a centered login form that works immediately."

**[Try typing in the inputs]**

> "The form is fully functional with proper state management."

---

### PART 3: Iterative Modification (90 seconds)

**[Type in chat]**

> "Now let's modify it. I'll ask for some changes."

**[Type: "Make the card elevated with more padding, and add a 'Forgot Password?' link"]**

**[Wait for generation]**

> "Notice it's not regenerating everything from scratch - it's making incremental modifications to the existing code."

**[Show code changes]**

> "You can see it updated the Card props and added the new link."

**[Show preview]**

> "The preview updates automatically with the elevated card and the new link."

**[Type: "Add a 'Remember Me' checkbox"]**

> "Let's add one more feature..."

**[Wait and show result]**

> "Perfect! The AI understood the context and added the checkbox in the right place."

---

### PART 4: Complex Example (90 seconds)

**[Clear by clicking Regenerate]**

> "Now let me show you something more complex."

**[Type: "Create a full dashboard with a sidebar navigation, top navbar with my profile, and a main area with 3 stats cards and a bar chart showing monthly sales data"]**

**[Wait for generation]**

> "This is where the 3-step agent really shines. It needs to:"
>
> "1. Choose the right layout structure - dashboard with navbar and sidebar"
> "2. Select multiple components - Navbar, Sidebar, Card, and Chart"
> "3. Arrange them properly with the right props"

**[Scroll through code]**

> "Look at this generated code - it's properly structured with all the components from our fixed library."

**[Show preview]**

> "And here's the result - a complete dashboard with navigation, stats, and data visualization."

**[Click through sidebar items]**

> "The navigation is functional, and everything is styled consistently."

---

### PART 5: Features Demo (90 seconds)

**[Switch viewport modes]**

> "The preview supports multiple viewport modes - desktop, tablet, and mobile."

**[Show each mode]**

> "The layout adapts automatically because we're using responsive Tailwind classes."

**[Click on History button]**

> "We also have version control. I can see all my previous generations..."

**[Click on an older version]**

> "...and roll back to any previous version instantly."

**[Edit code in Monaco editor]**

> "The code is fully editable. I can make manual changes..."

**[Change a color or text]**

> "...and the preview updates in real-time."

**[Click copy button]**

> "I can copy the code to use in my own projects..."

**[Click download button]**

> "...or download it as a TypeScript file."

---

### PART 6: Architecture Explanation (60 seconds)

**[Show README or draw diagram]**

> "Let me quickly explain the architecture."
>
> "The system has three main layers:"

> "**Layer 1: Fixed Component Library**"
> "8 pre-built components: Button, Card, Input, Table, Modal, Sidebar, Navbar, and Chart."
> "These never change - they're deterministic. Only their props can be configured."

> "**Layer 2: AI Agent Pipeline**"
> "Three specialized agents working in sequence:"
> "- Planner: Interprets intent, creates structured plan"
> "- Generator: Converts plan to React code"
> "- Explainer: Provides reasoning in plain English"

> "**Layer 3: User Interface**"
> "The 3-panel interface you've seen, with chat, code, and preview."

> "This architecture ensures reproducibility, safety, and explainability."

---

### PART 7: Key Features Summary (45 seconds)

> "To summarize the key features:"

**[Point to each as you mention]**

> "✅ **Deterministic**: Same input always gives same output"
>
> "✅ **Iterative**: Modify UIs incrementally, not from scratch"
>
> "✅ **Explainable**: Clear reasoning for every decision"
>
> "✅ **Safe**: Component whitelist prevents arbitrary code"
>
> "✅ **Versionable**: Full history and rollback support"
>
> "✅ **Editable**: Manual code editing with live preview"

---

### PART 8: Closing (30 seconds)

> "This project demonstrates:"
> "- Multi-step AI agent orchestration"
> "- Deterministic code generation"
> "- UI systems thinking"
> "- And production-ready engineering"

**[Show GitHub/deployment URL]**

> "The code is fully documented and deployed."
>
> "All the details are in the README, including:"
> "- Setup instructions"
> "- Architecture documentation"
> "- Component library details"
> "- Future improvements"

> "Thank you for watching! I hope you enjoyed this demo of the Ryze UI Generator."
